# Deep Learning Specialization by deeplearning.ai on Coursera

Programming assignments from all courses in the Coursera [Deep Learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) offered by `deeplearning.ai`.

> Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

The specialization covers a comprehensive range of deep learning topics, including:

**Course Breakdown:**
* **Fundamentals of Neural Networks and Deep Learning (Course 1):** Implement core deep learning algorithms like neural networks, backpropagation, and gradient descent.
* **Improving Deep Neural Networks (Course 2):** Explore techniques for optimizing deep learning models, such as hyperparameter tuning, regularization, and optimization algorithms.
* **Structuring Machine Learning Projects (Course 3):** Learn best practices for designing, implementing, and evaluating machine learning projects.
* **Convolutional Neural Networks (Course 4):** Deep dive into convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a powerful architecture for image recognition and other computer vision tasks.
* **Sequential Models (Course 5):** Build and train recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for sequence modeling tasks like natural language processing (NLP).

**Repository Structure:**
* Each course within the specialization has its own dedicated folder.
* Within each course folder, you'll find folders for the individual programming assignments.
* Assignment folders typically include: Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts containing the assignment code.

## Disclaimer

I recognize the hard time people spend on building intuition, understanding new concepts and debugging assignments. The solutions uploaded here are **only for reference**. They are meant to unblock you if you get stuck somewhere. I hope you don't copy any part of the code as-is (the programming assignments are fairly easy if you read the instructions carefully). Similarly, try out the quizzes yourself before you refer to the quiz solutions. This course is the most straight-forward deep learning course I have ever taken, with fabulous course content and structure. It's a treasure by the deeplearning.ai team.
